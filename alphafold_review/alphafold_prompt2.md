AlphaFold has unleashed the computational power to take in a sequence of amino acids and predict the geometric shape they fold into in nature. Conceptually, this looks like cross analyzing two pathways that consider the biologic and geometric information known about the amino acids in question. Biologically, it is important to consider evolutionary information such as co-evolving amino acids, which is useful in folding predictions. Geometrically, the model needs to look at how each atom it spatially placed. The amazing component of AlphaFold is its development of Evoformer, a transformer that has been specially adapted to predict protein shape. A classical transformer will look at linear sequences. The Evoformer makes its prediction based off a matrix system considered Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA). By using “attention”, the Evoformer can take in the refined information from both the biology tower and geometry tower as they run independently. This creates a complex exchange of information between the two crucial clues of protein shape: sequence and interaction. A key tool to accomplish this evaluation is triangular multiplicative updates and triangular self-attention. This is a mathematical method to establish the interaction between two amino acids and correctly organize them three dimensionally.
